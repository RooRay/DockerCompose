# NGINX Proxy Manager

I use NGINX Proxy Manager to give all my homelab containers subdomains and HTTPS easily so I don't have to remember IPs and ports and to ensure compatibility.

## Changes Made

- Enabled the  [healthcheck](https://nginxproxymanager.com/advanced-config/#docker-healthcheck) to make sure the container is running optimally
