# Dashdot
I use Dashdot to collect metrics on my systems performance and add them to Homarr. Currently I haven't used this much as I've been trying to get it to play nicely with other software.

## Modifications Made
Dashdot binds to port 82 on the host instead of 80 as port 80 is already in use by NGINX Proxy Manager
