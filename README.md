# Docker Compose Files
This repository hosts all the docker compose files I currently have deployed in my homelab and external VPS servers :)

In each folder you will find the compose file and a README.md explaining the changes I made. Most changes are minor tweaks and adjustments to get the software running optimally in Portainer. 

I currently run standard CLI Docker Compose on all servers running on either a Raspberry Pi 3B (with an extra 1GB of swap) or a RackNerd VPS in Atlanta with 3GB RAM, 2 vCPU Cores and 40GB storage, perfect for my (basic) needs. All servers run either Ubuntu 22.04 LTS or 24.04 LTS with Pro upgrades.
