# Docker Compose Files
This repository hosts all the docker compose files I currently have deployed in my homelab :)

In each folder you will find the compose file and a README.md explaining the changes I made. Most changes are minor tweaks and adjustments to get the software running optimally in Portainer. 

Currently I run Portainer Business Edition using a license key for free nodes (you can get this [here BTW](https://www.portainer.io/take-3)) but all these files should work in the Community Edition and regular docker compose just fine. No promises though.

All of the software in this repository runs on a Raspberry Pi 3B with Ubuntu Server 22.04 LTS 64-bit. Due to the Pi only having 1GB of RAM I gave it 2GB of swap to prevent it from crashing.
