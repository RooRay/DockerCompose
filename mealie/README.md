# Mealie
I use Mealie to store the recipes me and my family use frequently across a wide range of sources from paper cookbooks to online cooking websites.

## Modifications Made
I tweaked the maximum memory the container uses to keep my Raspberry Pi from running out of memory and crashing. I have not tested whether or not this has a detrimental impact on Mealie but it seems fine so far.
